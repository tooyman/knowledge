I would like to design bulk payment system that handle large payment instruction eg. a corporate can pay dividends to its shareholders. The instruction might contains millions of small transaction to process such as `debit transaction to corporate account` , `debit fee`, `debit withholding tax`, `credit dividend to shareholder`. on the credit side, transaction can be millions as they are many shareholders. I would like to design this applying event driven design according to Evans. design the ddd for me and tell me what should be my aggregate, domain model, event, repository, etc


Designing a bulk payment system using Event-Driven Design (EDD) requires breaking down the problem domain into smaller, more manageable components. Here is a high-level design for a bulk payment system that uses DDD:

Aggregate:

-   PaymentInstruction: represents a collection of individual payment transactions, such as debit transactions to corporate accounts, debit fees, debit withholding tax, and credit dividends to shareholders.

Domain Model:

-   PaymentInstruction: has properties such as ID, instruction type, status, and list of individual payment transactions.
-   PaymentTransaction: represents a single payment transaction with properties such as ID, account details (debit/credit), transaction amount, and status.

Events:

-   PaymentInstructionCreated: fired when a new payment instruction is created.
-   PaymentInstructionUpdated: fired when a payment instruction is updated.
-   PaymentInstructionCompleted: fired when a payment instruction is fully processed.
-   PaymentTransactionProcessed: fired when a single payment transaction is processed.
-   PaymentTransactionFailed: fired when a single payment transaction fails to process.

Repository:

-   PaymentInstructionRepository: responsible for persisting and retrieving PaymentInstruction aggregates.
-   PaymentTransactionRepository: responsible for persisting and retrieving PaymentTransaction aggregates.

Services:

-   PaymentInstructionService: responsible for coordinating the processing of a PaymentInstruction aggregate, including delegating to individual PaymentTransaction aggregates.
-   PaymentTransactionService: responsible for handling the processing of a single PaymentTransaction aggregate.

To process a bulk payment instruction, the PaymentInstruction aggregate is created with the list of individual PaymentTransaction aggregates. The PaymentInstruction aggregate is then persisted to the PaymentInstructionRepository, and the PaymentInstructionCreated event is fired.

When it is time to process the payment instruction, the PaymentInstructionService loads the PaymentInstruction aggregate from the PaymentInstructionRepository and delegates to the PaymentTransactionService to process each individual PaymentTransaction aggregate. When each PaymentTransaction aggregate is processed, the PaymentTransactionProcessed event is fired, and if there is a failure, the PaymentTransactionFailed event is fired.

As each PaymentTransaction aggregate is processed, the PaymentInstruction aggregate is updated to reflect the overall status of the payment instruction. When all PaymentTransaction aggregates have been processed, the PaymentInstructionCompleted event is fired, indicating that the payment instruction is fully processed.

Overall, this design for a bulk payment system using Event-Driven Design emphasizes the importance of breaking down the problem domain into smaller, more manageable components, and using events to coordinate the processing of these components. By focusing on the PaymentInstruction aggregate and individual PaymentTransaction aggregates, this design ensures that the bulk payment system is scalable, reliable, and flexible enough to handle large and complex payment instructions.

Aggregate:

-   PaymentInstruction: represents a collection of individual payment transactions, such as debit transactions to corporate accounts, debit fees, debit withholding tax, and credit dividends to shareholders.

Entity:

-   Shareholder: represents a shareholder with properties such as ID, name, and account details.
-   CorporateAccount: represents a corporate account with properties such as ID, name, and balance.

Value Objects:

-   Money: represents an amount of money with properties such as currency code and amount.

Bounded Context:

-   Payment: responsible for handling the payment transactions and processing the PaymentInstruction aggregate.

Repository:

-   PaymentInstructionRepository: responsible for persisting and retrieving PaymentInstruction aggregates.

Events:

-   PaymentInstructionCreated: fired when a new payment instruction is created.
-   PaymentInstructionUpdated: fired when a payment instruction is updated.
-   PaymentInstructionCompleted: fired when a payment instruction is fully processed.
-   PaymentTransactionProcessed: fired when a single payment transaction is processed.
-   PaymentTransactionFailed: fired when a single payment transaction fails to process.

Commands:

-   CreatePaymentInstruction: represents a command to create a new payment instruction with the list of individual payment transactions.
-   UpdatePaymentInstruction: represents a command to update an existing payment instruction.
-   ProcessPaymentInstruction: represents a command to process a payment instruction and its individual payment transactions.

The PaymentInstruction aggregate contains properties such as ID, instruction type, status, and list of individual payment transactions. Each PaymentTransaction aggregate represents a single payment transaction with properties such as ID, account details (debit/credit), transaction amount, and status.

To process a bulk payment instruction, the PaymentInstruction aggregate is created with the list of individual PaymentTransaction aggregates, including debit transactions to corporate accounts, debit fees, debit withholding tax, and credit dividends to shareholders. The PaymentInstruction aggregate is then persisted to the PaymentInstructionRepository, and the PaymentInstructionCreated event is fired.

When it is time to process the payment instruction, the ProcessPaymentInstruction command is executed, which loads the PaymentInstruction aggregate from the PaymentInstructionRepository and delegates to the PaymentTransactionService to process each individual PaymentTransaction aggregate. When each PaymentTransaction aggregate is processed, the PaymentTransactionProcessed event is fired, and if there is a failure, the PaymentTransactionFailed event is fired.

As each PaymentTransaction aggregate is processed, the PaymentInstruction aggregate is updated to reflect the overall status of the payment instruction. When all PaymentTransaction aggregates have been processed, the PaymentInstructionCompleted event is fired, indicating that the payment instruction is fully processed.

Overall, this design for a bulk payment system using Event-Driven Design emphasizes the importance of breaking down the problem domain into smaller, more manageable components, and using events and commands to coordinate the processing of these components. By focusing on the PaymentInstruction aggregate and individual PaymentTransaction aggregates, this design ensures that the bulk payment system is scalable, reliable, and flexible enough to handle large and complex payment instructions.
