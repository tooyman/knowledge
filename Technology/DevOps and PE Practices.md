Here's an evolutionary improvement of how implementation teams (developers, operations, infrastructure) have improved their collaboration over time:

1.  Waterfall Approach: In the traditional Waterfall approach, software development was organized into distinct phases such as design, development, testing, and deployment. Each phase was carried out by a separate team, and there was limited communication and collaboration between the teams. This approach often led to delays and quality issues, as well as a lack of flexibility and responsiveness to changing requirements.
    
2.  DevOps: DevOps emerged as a response to the limitations of the Waterfall approach. It emphasized the need for better collaboration between development and operations teams, as well as the use of automation to improve speed and efficiency. DevOps practices, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery, helped to reduce the time between writing code and seeing it deployed to production.
    
3.  Platform Engineering: As organizations adopted cloud-native architectures and began to rely more heavily on distributed systems and microservices, the need for a new approach to managing infrastructure and applications became apparent. Platform engineering emerged as a way to bring together developers and operators to build and manage a cloud-native platform for application development and deployment. Platform engineering emphasizes automation, scalability, and self-service, and helps to reduce the complexity and manual effort involved in managing modern, distributed systems.
    
4.  Site Reliability Engineering (SRE): SRE is a discipline that applies software engineering principles to operations and infrastructure management. SRE teams work to ensure that systems are reliable, scalable, and efficient, and that incidents are managed effectively. SRE has emerged as a response to the increasing complexity and scale of modern systems, and the need for a more structured and data-driven approach to operations.
    

Each of these approaches has built upon the strengths and weaknesses of the previous ones, and has responded to the changing needs and demands of modern software development and operations. While DevOps has been a significant improvement over the Waterfall approach, the rise of cloud-native architectures and distributed systems has highlighted the need for new approaches like platform engineering and SRE to ensure that organizations can build, deploy, and operate modern applications at scale.
